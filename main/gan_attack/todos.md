TODOs:

1. Apply images generated by the GAN in a label poisoning attack - measure their potency
2. Make adaptive G/D training triggers - based on whether the training is stalling for G or D

** For some reason Step 2 has a bug where the test accuracy never changes at all, regardless
of training the discriminator...maybe something doesn't clear itself out? Bad loss? Maybe
we should have to get consistent 1.00 in order to pass Step 2


[ ] Have GAN estimate multiple classes at once. This may help push the NN in the right direction,
given some shared features between different classes. (This requires a conditional GAN)

[ ] After training split learning, GAN needs the updated Discriminator (in EASY_MODE) or to refine the Discriminator o.w.
Right now, if Split Learning trains first, the GAN does not get an updated model. As simple as slg.gan.discriminator = _ ?

[ ] Add a loss and acc metrics to GAN D and G networks

[ ] Test the "better" label matching function

[ ] Remove dataset from GAN G training phase...not needed

[ ] Organize params

[ ] Reorganize local and global variables
