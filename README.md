## TODO's

#### Experiments

1. â˜‘ Show that we can approximate the Black-box model
    - Black-box complexity
    - Black-box accuracy
    
2. Optimize Black-box model approximation
    - Approximate black-box by using gradient patterns during training
    
3. Adapt GAN label poisoning attacks from Federated Learning to target Split Learning
    - Use gradient techniques to improve GAN attack performance

4. Perform backdoor label poisoning attacks

5. Evaluate Split Learning attack detection and prevention methods
